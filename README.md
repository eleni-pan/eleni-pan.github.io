## Bioinformatician / Biomedical Data Scientist

# ABOUT ME

Hey there! I'm a researcher with a background in Biotechnology from the Agricultural University of Athens, now exploring the exciting intersection of Machine Learning and Healthcare. I am currently enrolled in a [MSc in Data Science and Information Technologies](https://dsit.di.uoa.gr) with a Biomedical Data Science specialization in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and [Archimedes/Athena RC, Greece](https://archimedesai.gr/en/). 

My main focus is on neurodegenerative diseases (e.g dementia). I'm driven by the need for better early diagnostics and the hope that AI can become a valuable tool to support clinicians and improve patient outcomes. My master's thesis focuses on AI-Driven Analysis of Wavelet-Transformed Actigraphy Time Series: Developing Circadian Digital Biomarkers for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline under the supervision of Prof. Elias Manolakos. 

Outside of research, I love traveling, learning new languages and cultures, and staying active. Always curious, always learning!
