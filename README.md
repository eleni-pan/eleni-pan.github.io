## Bioinformatician / Biomedical Data Scientist

# ABOUT ME

Hey there! I'm a researcher with a background in Biotechnology, now exploring the exciting intersection of Machine Learning and Healthcare. My main focus is on neurodegenerative diseases (e.g dementia). I'm driven by the need for better early diagnostics and the hope that AI can become a valuable tool to support clinicians and improve patient outcomes.
Outside of research, I love traveling, learning new languages and cultures, and staying active. Always curious, always learning!
